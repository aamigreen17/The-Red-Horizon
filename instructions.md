# The-Red-Horizon
 A short, HTML-based game about taking control of the AI of a small mercenary spaceship as it aids the Starlight Legion against defeating a band of pirates. 

# Mechanics
The basic mechanics of the game are as follows:
- Acquiring a Target: The selected ship will become the Red Horizon’s primary target until a new ship is selected or it is destroyed
- Attacking: The Red Horizon has a chance to deal damage to the targeted ship
- Evasive Maneuvers: The Red Horizon has a chance to shake off any ships that may be locked onto it
- Missiles: The targeted ship is immediately destroyed
- Flares: All locked on ships are disoriented for a round
- Shields: The Red Horizon generates shields that absorb damage instead of the hull
- Bombs: All enemy ships have a chance to be injured
- Hull Integrity: Represents the health of the Red Horizon
- Heat: Represents how aggressive the Red Horizon is fighting. A higher heat means enemies are more likely to lock onto the Horizon

# Act 1
## Chapter 1
Introductory chapter, introduces the player to the basic mechanics of fighting as well as the world that they are in. The Red Horizon is on its way to answer a distress call heard out in open space, near pirate territory. It runs into a small group of pirates on the way over.
## Chapter 2
Once the Horizon deals with the pirates, it approaches the source of the distress call: a small merchant ship called The Wanderer with its engines disabled. It used its remaining ammunition to fight off the pirates, but more showed up before too long. The Horizon must protect the merchant ship from the pirates.

After the fight, the Horizon helps bring the ship's engines back to life and escorts it back to the nearest trading station in the region.
# Act 2
## Chapter 3
As a token of appreciation, the Wanderer repairs the Horizon and lets it replenish itself with the military-grade munitions it was transporting, including some missiles and flares.

The Horizon and the Wanderer head to Eclipse Station where they are met with another pirate force, this one even larger and looting the station. They’ve broken through the defenses and taken out the guard ships. The Horizon orders the Wanderer to stay behind while it goes and clears out the pirate forces.
## Chapter 4
As the Horizon clears out the pirate band looting the station, reinforcements show up to assist the pirates and reclaim their bounty. The Wanderer joins in the fight again, attempting to dock onto the station and repair the communications array to broadcast a signal to the Starlight Legion in the hopes it comes to drive the pirates away.

The Horizon protects the Wanderer long enough to get a signal out. The Legion comes out of hyperspace right in front of the station, intimidating the pirates with the massive size of its capital ship, The Starbreaker. After the pirates flee and the Legion steps in to assess the damage of the station, the Starbreaker makes contact with the Horizon, commending it for its bravery and combat effectiveness. It turns out the Wanderer was a supplier for the Legion, providing them with resources and munitions to keep the trade routes clear in the quadrant. It offers the Horizon a chance to come with the Shipbreaker and other Legion ships to take out the pirates’ base of operations in a nearby system. You can either be an assault ship designated to take out the reinforcements that will come to protect the pirate base, or a protector for the Wanderer as it transports a seismic charge to destroy the base completely. 
# Act 3a
## Chapter 5a
The Horizon will act as an assault vessel for the mission, and will deal with bands of reinforcements called back to the base. The Starbreaker has gifted the Horizon with more missiles and some military-grade detonation bombs in order to aid its assault.
## Chapter 6a
As a supply drone comes in from the Starbreaker to resupply the Horizon, another group of pirates comes in, giving the Horizon its toughest challenge yet.
# Act 3b
## Chapter 5b
The Horizon protects the Wanderer as it makes its way towards the center of the pirate base. The Starbreaker has gifted the Horizon with combat shields to keep it protected as it protects the Wanderer and its charge.
## Chapter 6b
The pirate’s central hub fires a plasma laser that destroys the bridge of the Wanderer, effectively wiping out the entire ship. The seismic charge was ejected from the ship towards the base as a final order. The Horizon must protect the volatile charge as it makes its way towards the base.
